        	<div class="contentTitle">The Article on OOPs features</div>
          <div class="contentText"><p>Encapsulation:  </p><br />
          <p>We have programmed the MotorBike class. Initially we started with public data members. But later we made all the data members and state of the objects as private. For e.g. we made speed and state(whether it's started or stopped) we made these private and to access these data we provided public getters and setters methods. That means no other class can directly change the state and behavious of MotorBike objects from outside. Further we also implemented some validations or rules for outside classes that were modifying the state of MotorBike class. This is information hiding. This is the first level of encapsualtion we did with MotorBike class.</p><br />
          <p>Below is the definition of encapsulation.</p>
          <p>Encapsulation in OOPs is the concept of binding fields (object state) and methods (behavior) together as a single unit. Programming languages such as Java use encapsulation in the form of classes. A class allows programmers to create objects with variables (data) and behaviors (methods or functions). Since a class consists of data and methods packed into a single unit, it is an example of encapsulation.</p></div>

        
        <div class="contentTitle">Abstraction: </div>
            <div class="contentText"><p>Let's take same example of a MotorBike. To Ride a MotorBike normally you don't need to know the internals of MotorBike like the engine and mechanics. That's an internal part. To start a motorbike you plug in the key on motorbike dashboard, put on the accelrator and gear etc. You don't care about the ignition and all that internal parts of engine. You will be worried about those only when there is a problem with your motorbike and you will ask a mechanic to do it. The user of the interface(that's you) does not care about implementation details. This concept of exposing only the necessary things you are interested in and hinding unwanted details is known as Abstraction. </p><br />
            </div>
        
        
        <div class="contentTitle">Inheritance: </div>
          <div class="contentText"><p>We can further extend our MotorBike class and we can create other two classes as Ducati, Honda and HarleyDavidson to implement the other features of the make such as it's power mileage etc. All Ducati bikes will have same features, all Honda bikes will have same features and all HarleyDavidson bikes will have superior features than Ducati and Honda. But irrespective of their make whether it's Ducati Honda or Davidson they are all MotorBikes hence they all have same characteristics of MotorBike. Their behaviour might be little bit different from make to make. Furthermore the motorbike objects of same make will be matching in behaviour exactly. </p><br />
          <p>Inheritance is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) feature that allows the properties of an object to be used by different objects.</p><br />
          <p>A written class can be inherited by another class.<br>
            When this process is done, all properties of the base class are transferred to the new class.<br>
            Reusability of the written code is ensured.<br>
            A base class is the parent class of a derived class.<br>
            The parent class of derived class is called Base Class, and the inherited class is called the Derived Class.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="contentTitle">Polymorphism: </div>
          <div class="contentText"><p>Polymorphism in OOPs is inseparable and an essential concept of every object-oriented programming language. An object or reference basically can take multiple forms in different instances. As the word suggests, ‘poly’ means ‘many’ and ‘morph’ points at ‘forms’; thus, polymorphism as a whole would mean ‘a property of having many forms.’ </p><br />
          <p>The object-oriented programming language processes classes and objects by a single interface. It implements the concepts of function overloading, overriding, and virtual functions. Also, it is typically used for instrumenting inheritance in programming.</p><br />
